Is it necessary to use a CSS framework? Is it possible to create a custom Design System, maintain it alive, involve the team on it's development and live happy with it?

I'm trying it.

Let's see if it works.

This is the core of the Design System. Also working on nakDS-custom and nakDS-pages.

nakDS is work in progress yet. Use it carefully.
