# TODO list & ideas

## TODO

- Add flex system
- Distribute the CSS on mixins to consume with more flexibility. Users don´t have to use my naming convention, that can be a real limitation. The solution right now is not stable because it doesn´t understand the nesting... maybe better to add a flag to mixinable classes to target?

## IDEAS
- Had to try all the circle to try to understand the concepts. Find challenges, find weak points.
- Simplify all the components. Can I remove all the variables and use only the tokens?
- Control what variables imports each component. How can I avoid repetitions? Sure that I can improve the performace. Undertand properly the custom properties and their duplication.
- Rebranding. Create your own reallity. ^^
