### Brand
- Create brand.

### Compilation, release, tools
- Refactor the gulfile. Better approach to have postcss.config.js on root?
- Add circleCI to publish npm
- Add browsersync
- Add property sorter
- Add stylelint on commit

### Distribution
- Distribute the CSS on mixins to consume with more flexibility. Users don´t have to use my naming convention, that can be a real limitation. The solution right now is not stable because it doesn´t understand the nesting... maybe better to add a flag to mixinable classes to target?
- Distribute the fonts in independent files to not to import all off them?
- Add dist to CDN

### Technical decisions
- Decide to repeat the classes or use only the modifier. Pros and cons

### Other
- Add semantic url
- Improve SEO
- Add accesibility 


## IDEAS
- Reproduce all the circle to try to understand the concepts. Find challenges, find weak points.
- Simplify all the components. Can I remove all the variables and use only the tokens?
- Control what variables imports each component. How can I avoid repetitions? Sure that I can improve the performace. Understand properly the custom properties and their duplication and its impact.
- Rebranding. Create your own reallity. ^^
- Stickers
- Goal: work the fullpage, modern layouts, 
- Define target. For visual landing pages. Marketing
- Easy to extend & scale
- Add philosophy: standard, simplicity, flexibility
