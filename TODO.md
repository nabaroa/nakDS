## IDEAS
- Had to try all the circle to try to understand the concepts. Find challenges, find weak points.
- Simplify all the components. Can I remove all the variables and use only the tokens?
- Control what variables imports each component. How can I avoid repetitions? Sure that I can improve the performace. Undertand properly the custom properties and their duplication.
